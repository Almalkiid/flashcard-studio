# Cardwright

**Flashcards that live in your notes, with the scheduling and control you know from Anki.**

Cardwright turns the Markdown you already write into spaced repetition flashcards, and schedules them with [FSRS](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/The-Algorithm), the modern algorithm Anki uses. It keeps a full review history, so you can undo an answer and see how your memory is doing. Every card and every review stays in plain files in your vault, and it works the same on desktop and on your phone.

> Cardwright is a fork of [Spaced Repetition](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition) by Stephen Mwangi, maintained by Kyle Klus. It keeps that plugin's card syntax and schedule format, so your existing cards work unchanged, and you can switch back at any time. See [Credits](#credits).

## Writing cards

Tag a note with `#flashcards`, or turn folders into decks in the settings. Then write cards in any of these styles:

```markdown
What is the capital of France::Paris

Question and answer both ways:::Reversed card

**What is the purpose of internal auditing?**
?

- Provide independent, objective assurance and consulting
- Add value and improve an organisation's operations

The CAE reports ==functionally== to the ==board==.
```

- `Question::Answer`: single-line card.
- `Question:::Answer`: single-line card, reviewed in both directions.
- `?` on its own line: multi-line card (`??` for both directions).
- `==highlight==`, `**bold**` or `{{curly braces}}`: cloze deletions.

Images, audio, LaTeX, code and footnotes work inside cards, because Obsidian renders them.

## Reviewing

Run **Cardwright: Review flashcards from all notes** from the command palette, or click the ribbon icon. Rate each card **Again**, **Hard**, **Good** or **Easy**. After an answer, a toast shows when you will see the card again, with an **Undo** button.

| Key                | Action                                                   |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Space or Enter     | Show answer, then Good                                   |
| 1, 2, 3, 4         | Again, Hard, Good, Easy (Anki keys)                      |
| Ctrl/Cmd + Z, or U | Undo last answer                                         |
| -                  | Bury until tomorrow                                      |
| @                  | Suspend                                                  |
| Ctrl/Cmd + 1 to 7  | Flag (red, orange, green, blue, pink, turquoise, purple) |
| S                  | Skip                                                     |

The number keys follow **Answer keys** in the settings. **Anki** (1 Again, 2 Hard, 3 Good, 4 Easy) is the default for new installs. **Original** (1 Hard, 2 Good, 3 Easy, 0 Reset the card) is the layout of the original Spaced Repetition plugin, and existing installs keep it until you change the setting.

On a phone, the same actions are in the card menu.

## Where your data lives

- **The schedule of each card** is an HTML comment after the card: `<!--SR:!fsrs,...,id=k3f9a2-->`. It is the same format the original plugin uses, plus a short card id and optional markers (`susp`, `bury=`, `flag=`, `leech`) that the original plugin ignores.
- **Your review history** is in `Cardwright/Review log/`, with one Markdown file per device per month (for example `2026-09 iphone-81c2.md`). Each answer is one line of JSON. Because every device writes only its own files, syncing with Obsidian Sync, iCloud or any other service never creates conflicts.
- **Settings** are in the plugin's `data.json`.

These plain files make it easy for scripts or AI assistants to read your progress and add cards.

## Installing

Until Cardwright is in the community plugin directory, install it with [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat):

1. Install and enable **BRAT** from the community plugins.
2. Run **BRAT: Add a beta plugin for testing** and enter `Almalkiid/cardwright`.
3. Enable **Cardwright** in the community plugins.

**Coming from Spaced Repetition?** Disable it and enable Cardwright. Your cards and schedules work as they are. To keep your settings, use **Settings, Data, Import settings from Spaced Repetition**.

## Network use

Cardwright works offline. It makes no network requests unless you turn on **Show update available status bar item** in the settings, which checks this repository's latest release on GitHub.
